# Pig-Latin-Translator

RULES OF PIG LATIN:

	- If the word begins with a consonent: every letter before the first vowel in the word is moved to the end of the word and the suffix -ay is added
						ex: "code" would be "odecay"
	
	- If the word begins with a vowel: the word is left as it is and the suffix -way is added. (some variations use -hay, or -yay, but we use -way)
						ex: "algorithm" would be "algorithmway" 
	
	** The letter Y can be treated as both a vowel or a consonent in pig latin, generally (there are exceptions) if the word starts with Y it is treated as a consonant and if the Y is in the middle or end of the word it is treated as a vowel
	
	** compound words are best broken up into its components
